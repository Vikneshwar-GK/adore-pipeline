# adore-pipeline

ADORE (Autonomous Data Operations and Recovery Engine) — a source-agnostic autonomous pipeline operations framework demonstrated through a city data pipeline ingesting weather, transit, and incident data from public APIs into BigQuery.
The AI agents autonomously investigate pipeline failures end-to-end — root cause, impact, exact fix, prevention — and present a complete repair package to the user for approval. User approves, rejects, or modifies. After approval, the agent implements and documents the fix. This Human-in-the-Loop design is intentional, not a limitation.
